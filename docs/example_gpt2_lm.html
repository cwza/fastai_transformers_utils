York&#39;s run of four defeats ended following a 1 – 1 draw away to Wycombe Wanderers, in which McGurk gave York the lead before the home team levelled through Dean Morgan. Taft was sent back to Leicester after he fell behind McGurk, Parslow and Smith in the pecking order for a central defensive berth.

With Pope preferred in goal, &lt;unk&gt; returned to Blackpool on his own accord, although his loan agreement would stay in place until January 2014. York then drew 0 – 0 away to Morecambe.

York drew 0 – 0 at home with second @-@ placed Oxford United, in which Carson came closest to scoring with a volley that &lt;unk&gt; across the face of the goal. This was followed by another draw after the match away to Accrington Stanley finished 1 – 1, with the home team &lt;unk&gt; 10 minutes after a Fletcher penalty had given York the lead in the 35th @-@ minute. Striker &lt;unk&gt; McDonald, who had been released by Peterborough United, was signed on a contract until the end of the season.
